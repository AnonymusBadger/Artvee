"Swiss glass painter, woodcut designer, etcher, book illustrator and writer. He was the son and pupil of the glass painter and councilor Jos Murer (1530-1580), founder of a family of artists who lived in Zurich in the 16th and 17th centuries. In about 1574, at age 16, he traveled to Strasbourg where he learned the art of woodcutting from Tobias Stimmer, an artist with whom he collaborated on a number of projects.

In 1577 he collaborated with his father on a cycle of 13 pairs of panes representing Thirteen Historic Scenes of the Swiss Confederation for the Zisterzienkloster of Wettingen, Aargau. Christoph's monograms (SM, STM) are on three panes. He probably followed this work with study travels.

In 1579 he designed a cycle of panes in Basle for the well-known citizen Leonhard Thurneysser (1531-96), celebrating the adventurous life of this much-travelled goldsmith, alchemist, astrologer and personal physician to the Elector of Brandenburg. Of the original cycle, two paintings, including the Birth of Leonhard Thurneysser of Basle in 1531 (1579; Öffentliche Kunstsammlung, Basle), and two design sketches (?1579; private collection) have survived. These early paintings, using strong colours, have wide architectural frames in the foreground giving views on to the different episodes from Thurneysser's life, several richly orchestrated scenes being included within each of the architectural frames. After them Murer travelled to Strasbourg, and a fine sequence of nine numbered sketches for glass paintings, probably representing the Nine Muses (Museum der Bildenden Künste, Leipzig), is likely to be from Strasbourg, where Murer is documented during 1583 and 1584.

In 1586 he returned to Zurich, where he joined the Saffron guild and began working as a glass painter. As his career advanced, he gained recognition as a painter of stained glass, printmaker, portraitist and playwright. He is known for the exquisite stained glass panels in the Ruchner Mansion in Nuremberg, among other commissions. Later, he was employed by Emperor Rudolf II in Prague and the Bishop of Bamberg in southern Germany. He is also known for producing the illustrations for Jacob Micyllus' edition of Ovid's Metamorphoses, published in 1582, which may be the time period in which this work was produced.

His brother, Josias Murer (1564-1630) executed designs and paintings for the Zurich city hall, as well as created numerous stained-glass panels of coats of arms for churches and city halls throughout the region.

"Charles Buckles Falls, also known as C. B. Falls, was an American artist, most known for his illustrations and writings. He is the author and illustrator of several books, including The ABC Book. He is also known for his World War I poster advertisements, such as Books Wanted.

Charles Buckles Falls was born on December 10, 1874, in Fort Wayne, Indiana. In his early twenties he moved to Chicago, where he began his career as an architect's assistant and as a sketch artist for the Chicago Tribune. While working as an architect's assistant, he taught himself how to draft and ultimately became a freelance artist. Unhappy with his salary, Falls left the Chicago Tribune and moved to New York City around 1900. While in New York, he struggled to find work until he met the artist and author Joseph Pennell.

Falls illustrated many different books for various authors, as well as various magazines and posters. During World War I, he was a member of the Society of Illustrators, with whom he produced war propaganda for the Committee on Public Information's Division of Pictorial Publicity.

While he is most commonly known for his illustrations of posters and books, Falls was also involved in many different art forms. He designed fabrics, furniture, and even trade bindings. He was also involved in stage design, helping to design scenery and costumes for the American Society of Illustrators, as well as the Palace Theatre and Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York. In 1914, Falls wrote, directed, and starred in a play called ""Perfectly Happy"" that performed at the Berkeley Theatre.

Falls also created designs and illustrations for various magazines, including Vogue, Redbook, Collier's, and Everybody's magazines, as well as various companies such as Dodd, Meade, & Co., Edison & Co., and Marshall Field & Co..

"The National Institutes of Health is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and public health research. It was founded in the late 1880s and is now part of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The majority of NIH facilities are located in Bethesda, Maryland and other nearby suburbs of the Washington metropolitan area, with other primary facilities in the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina and smaller satellite facilities located around the United States. The NIH conducts its own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program.

As of 2013, the Intramural Research Program (IRP) had 1,200 principal investigators and more than 4,000 postdoctoral fellows in basic, translational, and clinical research, being the largest biomedical research institution in the world, while, as of 2003, the extramural arm provided 28% of biomedical research funding spent annually in the U.S., or about US$26.4 billion.

The NIH comprises 27 separate institutes and centers of different biomedical disciplines and is responsible for many scientific accomplishments, including the discovery of fluoride to prevent tooth decay, the use of lithium to manage bipolar disorder, and the creation of vaccines against hepatitis, Haemophilus influenzae (HIB), and human papillomavirus (HPV).

In 2019, the NIH was ranked number two in the world, behind Harvard University, for biomedical sciences in the Nature Index, which measured the largest contributors to papers published in a subset of leading journals from 2015 to 2018.

"Tadeusz Makowski was a Polish painter who worked in France and was associated with the School of Paris.

From 1902 to 1906, he studied classical philology at the Jagiellonian University. During that time, he also began studying art at the Kraków Academy of Fine Arts with Jan Stanisławski and Józef Mehoffer. Upon completing his courses there in 1908, he moved to Paris, where he would live for the rest of his life.

Originally he painted in the style taught by his professors. Then, he painted some frescoes that attracted the attention of a group of Cubist painters, led by Henri Le Fauconnier, who worked in Montparnasse. This had a decisive influence on his work.

At the invitation of Władysław Ślewiński, he spent the war years in Brittany and would return there several times. These trips inspired him to depart from strict cubism and go back to studying nature; creating many stylized landscapes.

Later, his favorite subjects were carnivals, fairs and children, done in a style inspired by the old Dutch Masters, Polish folk art and naïve art. He also did woodcut book illustrations. During the 1920s, he lived briefly in the Netherlands. From 1912 to 1931, he kept a diary that was published in Warsaw in 1961 by the State Publishing Institute (PIW).

"Sidney H. Riesenberg was an illustrator and artist who lived in Yonkers, New York, and commuted to his studio in New York City by train. He was known as a professional illustrator for his posters for the United States Marine Corps and the Liberty bond programs, for his illustrations for book covers, magazines, and for oil paintings of diverse subjects. He retired from his professional work and dedicated his full-time energy to painting fine arts and teaching. In 1937 he began spending summers in Rockport, Massachusetts, where he painted scenes of the small fishing town. He was active in the Rockport Art Association, teaching oil painting and participating in water color figure painting classes.

Riesenberg was born in 1885 in Chicago. He was educated at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where he was recognized for his compositions in oil. He moved to Yonkers in 1905 where he began his career as a professional illustrator, after a sojourn in the American west pursuing what became a lifelong interest in depicting the frontier west as was being popularized then by Zane Grey and other writers. In the early 1930s, he began doing illustration work for magazines. In the 1930s and 1940s, his work was often featured at venues such as the National Academy of Design and in organizations such as the Allied Artists of America. In the 1950s he was an art instructor at the Westchester Workshop in White Plains, New York. Riesenberg was also vice president of the Yonkers Art Association.

Riesenberg had an older brother, Felix, with whom he was close. Riensenberg died in 1971 in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

Of Riesenberg's work, his contributions during World War I are well known and he is described as ""one of the greatest illustrators of the World War I era."" Riensenberg's style, it has been said, shows influences from Impressionism.

He produced many posters for the Marines in addition to posters advertising the Liberty Loan campaign during World War I. One of Riesenberg's most well known works is his 1918 World War I-era poster, Over the Top for You, which illustrates a young doughboy clutching the American flag. With its bold illustration and concise text, like many war posters of the time, Over the Top for You encouraged the public to support its military by purchasing liberty loans. Among other posters, it was selected to display in the Smithsonian American Art Museum under the exhibit, Over the Top: American Posters from World War I. Riesenberg also created several posters for the United States Navy, one of which, titled Democracy's Vanguard, illustrates Marines landing from a boat to initiate an offensive. Another illustrated uniformed soldiers raising the flag against the background of a warship.

Riesenberg created illustrations, including covers, for many publications such as Boys' Life Magazine, the monthly magazine of the Boy Scouts of America, Harper's and The Saturday Evening Post. His many thematic subjects included scenes from places he lived, historical and action scenes, portraits, as well as depicting the Old West.
